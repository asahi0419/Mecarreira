  "each player contract goes": "Each player contract goes through 2 stags once it is launched, with each stage having various different functionalities enabled. Every player, no matter how famous has to go through Stage 1 to reach Stage 2. Stage one is called “Subscription” and stage 2 is named “PRO”. Becoming Pro therefore means on meCarreira that the player moves from Stage 1 to Stage 2.",
  "the way to move from": "The way to move from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (becoming PRO) is by having enough market value and enough supporters. The exact requirements to become Pro are set by meCarreira but are publicly visible in the factsheet (available on website). They can vary over time, depending on the activity.",
  "players that never reach": "Players that never reach enough momentum to become PRO on meCarreira will stay in Stage 1 (Subscription) indefinite but as trading will never be deactivated and coins can always be bought and sold, the player might reach the criteria to become pro at a later stage.",
  "once a player reaches": "Once a player reaches PRO (Stage 2), features such as NFT, Auctions, Draws, Votes and Staking are enabled. PRO Players are traded on public exchanges and the liquidity is moved to public exchanges (like UNISWAP).",
  "to buy Player-Coins you": "To buy Player-Coins you can chose between Credit-Card and Cryptocurrency (Polygon). The easiest and fastest way is to load up your wallet with Polygon (Matic) cryptocurrency and then buy directly Player-Coins. You can buy MATIC (Polygon) on almost any major cryptocurrency exchange and then send it to your wallet you have on meCarreira.com. You can also use the “Get MATIC” button In your wallet and buy Polygon (Matic) with your Credit-Card and receive them directly into your wallet. All Player-Coins can be bought with Polygon (MATIC).",
  "alternatively, you can use": "Alternatively, you can use credit-card to buy Players coins directly. If you chose to pay with Credit- Card, we link you with our Credit-Card Provider Wert.io that is a licensed and regulated entity in the EU. They will process your card safely and convert your Money from your card automatically into Polygon (MATIC) and then buy player coins with that and send it to your wallet. You do not have to do anything but to chose the amount of player-coins you want to buy and all the rest happens in the background.",
  "whenever you sell Player-Coins": "Whenever you sell Player-Coins, you get Polygon (Matic) back to your wallet. In order to cash out Polygon as well, you can sell them on any exchange or convert them into USDT for example on Uniswap exchange . You can cash out easily back to your bank account with regulated exchanges such as Kraken.",
  "drafting is available": "Drafting is available for Players in Stage 1 (Subscription) and Stage 2 (PRO). Every player can draft up to 5 other players at any given time. This means a Player can draft more than 5 players over time but can never have more than 5 active drafts.",
  "when a player drafts": "When a player drafts another player, it is publicly visible and it has benefits for Drafter (the one who initiated it) and the draftee (the one who got drafted). The Drafter will get paid cash if the player he/she drafted will become PRO (Stage 2). It is a kickback fee for supporting him/her to success. The draftee benefits before then every time someone buys coins from the drafter, the system automatically takes a percentage (usually 2%) and buys coins of the draftee.",

  "john receives 98 USD": "John receives 98 USD of Player A coins and 2 USD worth of PlayerB coins.",
  "players getting drafted": "Players getting drafted by high profile players will almost definitely have the best chances to reach PRO themselves.",
  "voting works that way that": "Voting works that way that the Player launches a vote where he/she places a specific question with couple answers as options. Then coin holders can reply and the more coins you have, the more voting power you got. If you own 10% of all coins, your answer is much more powerful than someone with 0.5% of coins only. Votes are on the blockchain and cannot be faked or manipulated. All you have to do is to select an answer and click on “vote”.",
  "NFTs are digital artworks": "NFTs are digital artworks issued on the blockchain. Every NFT gets his own coin that represents the ownership of that NFT. NFTs can be sent around or sold again on third party platform such as OpenSea or Rarible. The owner of the NFT is the owner of the artwork and the claim(see below) and owns all the rights to it.",
  "on meCarreira players": "On meCarreira players are the issuers of NFTs. They ultimately decide which NFTs are launched and how they are launched(Auction, Raffle, Charity, etc.).",
  "auctions are done for NFTs": "Auctions are done for NFTs where the player selects a certain NFT and decides to auction it off. The only way to participate in the auction is by owning Player Coins and stake them. Every auction has an end date and once passed, the highest bidder gets the NFT including all “claiming rights” to it and is free to do with the NFT what he/she wants. Only the coins of the highest bidder are locked and once the auction is won, taken and moved into the liquidity pool and therefore given back to the community. If you are the highest bidder, keep in mind that your coins are locked until the auction is finished.",
  "raffles or sometimes referred": "Raffles or sometimes referred to as Draws are a type of lottery where the player selects an NFT and lets everybody participate in the raffle until a certain deadline has been reached. Then a random selection takes place and a lucky winner is drawn and gets the NFT for free. The more coins you have staked, the higher your chance is to win in the draw. Someone with 1000 coins staked has 10 times more chance to win than someone with 100. Once you won the NFT, you are free to send or sell it as you please. In order to participate you must stake and then actively participate by clicking the participation button. This is to prevent inactive owners from winning anything.",
  "some NFTs can have a claim": "Some NFTs can have a claim. A claim is basically a right to redeem something. Real World Items such as match worn boots, jerseys or other items but also experiences can be placed into a claim and the NFT represents this claim, making the owner of the NFT the owner of the claim. This allows the owner to sell it digitally without having to send them around. Claims can be redeemed through meCarreira where meCarreira AG acts as bridge between the player(issuer) and NFT holder(redeemer) but meCarreira has no impact on what players place into their NFTs as they are the issuers.",
  "player-Coins can only be": "Player-Coins can only be sent once a player reaches PRO status. At any time, they can be bought and sold but not sent. The reason the sending is limited is that we want to prevent secondary markets to show up before the player has been through its subscription phase. The coins are never locked and they are in your wallet at any time.",
